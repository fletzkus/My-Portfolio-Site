          <h2><strong>Product Design</strong></h2>
          <p>This is a pattern I made using Adobe Illustrator for a product design assignment in my
          Digital Studio course. </p>
          <p>The product I designed was a paper food tray like the one you would
          a hotdog or nachos in at a baseball game. I wanted to create a redesign of this style of food tray
          for a different target audience. My invisioned target audience is a food truck selling baked good,
          such as a bakery or a cupcake truck. </p>
          <p>I designed the colors around this idea as well:
            the yellow reminds me of butter and croissants;
            the green reminds think of pistachio;
            the pink reminds me of strawberry;
            and the white reminds me of icing and whipped cream.
          </p>
          <p>The sharp corners I used in the shapes of the design are there to give relief
            from the softness of the colors and to tie in the sharper corners of the tray's shape.</p>

          <h2><strong>LinkedIn Backdrop</strong></h2>
          <p>This is a pattern design I created to use for my LinkedIn backdrop.
            I built it using PowerPoint's shapes and lines, not a template!</p>
